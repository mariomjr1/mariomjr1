# Hi there! üëã I'm Mario Murakami, MD

I'm a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** at the **Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging (MGH) & Harvard Medical School**, bridging the gap between clinical neuroscience and computational analysis. With a background as a Medical Doctor (MD), my passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques and software development to understand the brain and explore solutions for neurological and psychiatric conditions.

### üî≠ Current Research & Interests

My primary goal is to integrate multimodal neuroimaging data to build comprehensive models of brain structure, function, and metabolism. Currently exploring:

* Mechanisms of neuroinflammation in conditions like **Long-COVID** using PET-MR (e.g., `[11C]PBR28`) and MRS.
* Brain plasticity and inflammation following **Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)** using rsfMRI, PET-MR, and advanced dMRI (Connectome 2.0).
* Developing robust, reproducible analysis pipelines for longitudinal and multi-site neuroimaging studies.
* The application of graph theory and network neuroscience to understand connectome alterations.

### üå± Learning & Future Directions

I'm continuously expanding my skillset, currently diving deeper into:

* Advanced Machine Learning techniques for neuroimaging (CNNs, GCNs).
* Graph Convolutional Networks for analyzing brain connectivity data.
* Transformer models and attention mechanisms applied to neurological time-series or imaging data.
